like Iron *, Diamond ✦ and Coal #.
Once you've done that go to a **Shop** represented by a "$"
and use "🛒" to access the shop 
In if you have any of those **ores** select the right reaction 
to select the one you want to sell then use "!sell [amount]" to sell your ores.
To escape the shop use "❌"
**NOTE :** 
**-in shop you won't be able to move or mine**
**-shop's articles will change every 2 day**
